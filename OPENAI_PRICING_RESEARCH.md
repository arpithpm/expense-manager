## 🔧 **Implementation Recommendations**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Cost Optimization**
```swift
// Change model from:
"model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"

// To:
"model": "gpt-4o-mini"
```

**Expected Results:**
- 94% immediate cost reduction
- Same multimodal capabilities
- Maintained receipt processing quality

### **Phase 2: Daily Scans Credit System**
```swift

    @Published var scansUsedToday: Int = 0
    @Published var lastResetDate: Date = Date()
    @Published var isSubscribed: Bool = false
    
    private let dailyLimit = 10
    
    var scansRemaining: Int {
        if isSubscribed { return Int.max }
        checkDailyReset()
        return max(0, dailyLimit - scansUsedToday)
    }
    
    var canScanToday: Bool {
        if isSubscribed { return true }
        checkDailyReset()
        return scansUsedToday < dailyLimit
    }
    
    func consumeScan() -> Bool {
        if isSubscribed { return true }
        checkDailyReset()
        if scansUsedToday < dailyLimit {
            scansUsedToday += 1
            saveToUserDefaults()
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
    
    private func checkDailyReset() {
        let calendar = Calendar.current
        if !calendar.isDate(lastResetDate, inSameDayAs: Date()) {
            scansUsedToday = 0
            lastResetDate = Date()
            saveToUserDefaults()
        }
    }
    
    func getModelForCurrentTier() -> String {
        return "gpt-4o-mini"  // Optimized model for all users
    }
}
```

### **UI Implementation Examples**
```swift
// Scan button with daily counter
Button(action: scanReceipt) {
    VStack {
        Image(systemName: "camera.fill")
        if !dailyScansManager.isSubscribed {
            Text("📸 Scan Receipt (\(dailyScansManager.scansRemaining) left today)")
                .font(.caption)
        } else {
            Text("📸 Scan Receipt (Unlimited)")
                .font(.caption)
        }
    }
}
.disabled(!dailyScansManager.canScanToday && !dailyScansManager.isSubscribed)

// Daily limit reached prompt
if !dailyScansManager.canScanToday && !dailyScansManager.isSubscribed {
    VStack(spacing: 16) {
        Text("🎯 Daily scan limit reached!")
            .font(.headline)
        Text("Resets at midnight or upgrade for unlimited scanning")
            .font(.subheadline)
            .foregroundColor(.secondary)
        
        Button("Upgrade to Premium - $1.99/month") {
            showSubscriptionView = true
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
    }
    .padding()
